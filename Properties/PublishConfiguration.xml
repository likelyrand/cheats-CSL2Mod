	<LongDescription>
		This mod is pretty simple, basic cheats to not have to use the developer mode.
		
		You can find the cheats in the settings menu. (ESC -> Settings -> Cheats)

		### Functions:

		- **Unlock Milestones**: Unlock next milestone or unlock all milestones.
		- **Add/Subtract Money**: Easy addition and subtraction of money with a slider.
		- **Add/Subtract Development Points**: Easy addition and subtraction of development points with a slider.
		- **Unlock items from Milestones**: Keeps selected milestone and previous milestones locked, e.g. you can unlock buses from Milestone 4 while still being at Milestone 0.
		- **Unlock individual prefabs**: Need the prefab type (such as BuildingPrefab) and name (such as BusDepot01), does not unlock dependencies such as UI category and menu.
		- **Keybinds**: Unlock next or all milestones, add or subtract 500k money aswell as add or subtract 1 development point.
		
		That's all there really is to it. Keybinds are not set by default. This mod is fully safe to remove.
